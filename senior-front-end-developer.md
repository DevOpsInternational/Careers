## Senior Front-end developer

We’re looking for a Remote Digital Nomad to join DevopsInternational B.V. team to craft software for a cause.

*As an employer, restricting your hiring to a small geographic region means you’re not getting the best people you can. As an employee, restricting your job search to companies within a reasonable commute means you’re not working for the best company you can. #DHH #Rework*

At DevopsInternational, we follow #Rework philosophy in the way we develop software and launch products.

**Location** - Somewhere around Bangalore/Ahmedabad/Hyderabad (#Heisenberg)  

We have presence and co-working spaces in Amsterdam, Bangalore and Ahmedabad but being a group of digital nomads, you're not obligated to work from our office locations. We also have some of our employees working from Rotterdam, Pune, and Hyderabad and soon from San Francisco and Copenhagen.

-   You are perfect match if you know - ANTD, Redux, Webpack, (Jest),Sonarcloud/Qube
-   We take a bow if you know any of these - GraphQL, D3JS, E2E testing 
-   Expert remote backend developer having good knowledge of React.js ecosystem.
-   Independent, scalable and willing to go the extra mile to develop products with clean code.
-   Someone who doesn't build software only for work but also for himself/herself as a hobby to learn something new.

What we offer:

-   Some of the coolest technologies to develop decentralised applications, explore graph architecture and build smart algorithms to solve complex problems.
-   Be a part of the team that develops software, which creates a positive impact for the society.
-   A co-working space when you wish to meet, collaborate and celebrate with your colleagues
-   Access to unlimited technical learning materials.
-   Visit to an exotic location every year as part of yearly get together.
